# SPL-1

This project involves a file manipulation tool for encryption/decryption and compression/decompression which will support any text file.

The tool includes 4 Algorithms:
Encryption/Decryption:
  1. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
  2. BlowFish 
Compression/Decompression:
  1.Huffman
  2.LZW
It will ask the user to choose Encryption, Decryption, Compression, Decompression option and upon selecting it, the user can select preferred algorithm.
The user will enter the file path where the file exists and the tool will perform the selected operation.
